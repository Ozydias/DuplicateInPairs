        <p>The Paris 2024 Olympic Games will not only be a global sporting event, 
          but also a symbol of progress in environmental protection, 
          technological innovation and social inclusion. As the host city for the third time, 
          Paris is committed to becoming carbon neutral, 
          with an emphasis on gender equality and the participation of vulnerable groups. 
          Through the Games, Paris will showcase the Olympic spirit of global cooperation, 
          peace and solidarity.
